Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\\n\\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\\nWhich of the following could Gordon's test show?\\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\"},\n",

Carter needed to decide how many panels to install and which side of the roof to install them on. If he put the panels on the side that got the most sun, then he could use fewer panels, and the client would save money. Carter installed sunlight sensors on both sides of the roof. Then, he measured the amount of sunlight the sensors on each side of the roof recorded over one sunny summer day.\\nFigure: installing solar panels on a roof.\\nWhich of the following could Carter's test show?\\nA. the amount of sunlight the roof would get throughout the year\\nB. how many solar panels could fit on each side of the roof\\nC. which side of the roof got more sun over one day\"},\n",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\\n\\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour.

He read that using a heating pad to heat up potting soil could help make seeds germinate, or sprout, faster. Kenneth wondered whether the temperature of the heating pad would affect how quickly the seeds germinated.\\nKenneth prepared two potting trays, each made up of ten small pots of soil. He planted one cucumber seed in each small pot and arranged the potting trays near a sunny window. He set an electric heating pad to 75¬∞F and placed it under one potting tray. He set a second heating pad to 85¬∞F and placed it under the other potting tray. Kenneth observed the pots daily, and he counted the number of days it took until a seed germinated in each pot.\\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

She wanted to design a new turbine that would produce 10% more electricity than older wind turbines. She thought that a turbine made from lightweight material would turn more easily and produce more electricity. So, Rose created a computer model of a turbine made from lightweight material.

Read the passage and think about the variables that are described.\\n\\nDr. Spencer was the land manager for a prairie that had become overrun by unwanted grasses. These grasses crowded out other plants. Dr. Spencer thought that she could use fire to remove the unwanted grasses and allow other plants to grow. But she didn't know how often the prairie should be burned.\\nDr. Spencer marked off six plots within a large area of the prairie. She used carefully controlled fires to burn all of the plants in each plot. She burned three of the plots once a year for three years. She burned the other three plots twice a year for three years. A year after the last fire, Dr. Spencer counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots.\\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating. A dependent variable is a variable that you measure.\\nFigure: a fire burning through a prairie.\\nWhich of the following was an independent variable in this experiment?\\nA. the number of times the plots were burned each year\\nB. the number of unwanted grasses\\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.\",\n",
